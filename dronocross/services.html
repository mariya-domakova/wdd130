                        <h3>Search and rescue</h3>
                        <p>Search and rescue operations involve searching for missing persons, hikers, 
                            or victims of natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods. 
                            Traditionally, these operations were conducted using helicopters, ground teams, 
                            and trained dogs. However, drones are proving to be a valuable addition 
                            to the search and rescue toolkit due to their ability to quickly cover large 
                            areas and provide real-time information on the location of missing persons.<br>
                            Drones equipped with thermal cameras and infrared sensors can detect heat 
                            signatures from a distance, which can help rescuers locate missing persons 
                            or victims who may be difficult to spot with the naked eye. In addition, 
                            drones can be equipped with high-resolution cameras to capture images and 
                            video footage of the search area, which can be used to create detailed maps 
                            and identify potential hazards.<br>
                            The use of drones in search and rescue operations truly has the potential 
                            to save lives and reduce the risk of injury to search teams. Drones can 
                            quickly provide valuable information to rescuers, allowing them to make 
                            informed decisions and locate missing persons or victims more efficiently.</p>

                        <h3>Wind turbine maintenance</h3>
                        <p>Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and other sensors can be used to 
                            inspect wind turbines for damage, wear and tear, and other issues.<br>
                            Traditionally, wind turbine inspections were carried out by human technicians 
                            who would climb the tower to inspect the blades and other components. This is 
                            a dangerous and time-consuming process that requires a lot of resources. 
                            Drones, on the other hand, can quickly and safely inspect wind turbines from 
                            the air. They can be programmed to fly a pre-determined route around the 
                            turbine and capture high-resolution images and video footage of the blades, 
                            nacelle, and other components.<br>
                            In addition to cameras, drones used for wind turbine inspections can also be 
                            equipped with other sensors, such as lidar, which uses laser technology to 
                            create 3D maps of the wind turbine and detect any structural issues.<br>
                            The data collected by drones during wind turbine inspections can be used to 
                            identify any areas of damage or wear and tear that need to be repaired. 
                            This can help prevent costly downtime and ensure that the turbines are 
                            operating at maximum efficiency.<br>
                            <!-- Overall, the use of drones in wind turbine inspections is a cost-effective 
                            and efficient way to inspect these structures for maintenance and repair needs. 
                            Drones can provide a safe and accurate way to inspect wind turbines and help 
                            ensure that they are operating at optimal levels. -->

                        <h3>Filmmaking and photography</h3>
                        <p>Aerial photography is another popular application of drones. Drones equipped with 
                            high-resolution cameras can capture stunning images and videos from unique vantage 
                            points that were once only accessible to helicopters or airplanes.<br>
                            Aerial photography by drones has become increasingly popular in recent years, 
                            with many photographers, videographers, and filmmakers using drones to capture 
                            breathtaking footage for a variety of projects. This includes everything from 
                            real estate and commercial photography to wedding and event photography, as well 
                            as documentary filmmaking.<br>
                            One of the key advantages of using drones for aerial photography is their ability 
                            to fly at low altitudes, providing a more intimate and detailed perspective than 
                            traditional aerial photography methods. Drones can also fly in areas that may be 
                            difficult or impossible to access by other means, such as over water or in densely populated areas.
                            In addition to traditional photography, drones can also be equipped with specialized 
                            cameras and sensors, such as thermal cameras or multispectral cameras, to capture images 
                            and data that would be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional photography methods.
                            <!-- Aerial photography by drones offers a unique and exciting way to capture images and 
                            footage from the air. With their ability to fly at low altitudes and access hard-to-reach areas, 
                            drones are becoming an increasingly popular tool for photographers, videographers, and filmmakers 
                            who are looking to capture stunning aerial imagery. -->
