    <p class="intro">Hi! I am a 26 years old girl living in Moscow, Russia. Here are some facts about me:</p>
    <p>I am convinced that it's never late to change occupation! After pursuing my first Bachelor's degree in 
        teaching German and English, I realized I had chosen the wrong path. During the 
        pandemic I first got an idea of changing my profession and taking some programming courses. That was 
        the time I was introduced to BYU Pathway, a program that changed my life. When I was in the third 
        semester of PathwayConnect, I took a python class with no programming background, and I loved it! 
        Now I want to learn other programming languages to become a web developer.</p>
    <p>I am a proud member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I got baptized in 2018 at the age of 21. 
        In October 2022 I was finally able to attend a temple for the first time and get my own endowment.</p>
    <p>I love travelling and exploring cultures! I have visited 7 countries so far. My goal is to work remotely, 
        so I can go abroad any time I want. Having started my degree in programming is the first step towards my dream!</p>
